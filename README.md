# Bandit-Algorithm-in-Chemistry
This repository contains datasets, collected data, and analysis code for applying bandit algorithms to chemical reaction optimization.
- Original Datasets: Experimental data originally generated by the Doyle Group.
- Collected Data: Includes newly gathered PPF-related datasets collected as part of this project, expanding the available data landscape beyond previous work.
- Test Scenarios 1 & 2: Entirely new datasets designed and collected to evaluate bandit algorithm performance under different chemical conditions.
- Code: Developed to implement and compare multiple bandit strategies while extending the range of reaction parameters and algorithmic variations explored.
