# Bandit-Algorithm-in-Chemistry
Original datasets, code, and collected data
- Original datasets are collected by the Doyle Group
- In the Collected Data folder, some of the data are collected by the Doyle Group and some PPF related data are newly collected by myself
- Test Scenario 1 and 2 data are all newly collected by myself
- Most of the code originated from the Doyle's Group. Modifications are done to expand the scope of parameters tested and the variations of algorithms explored.
