Original datasets, code, and collected data
- Original datasets are collected by the Doyle Group
- Most of the code originated from the Doyle's Group (can be found on GitHub) with modification done to expand the scope / algorithm explored. The code uploaded to this repository are code that I used to run all related programs.
